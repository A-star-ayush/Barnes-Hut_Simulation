## Parallel Barnes-Hut algorithm

The Barnesâ€“Hut simulation (Josh Barnes and Piet Hut) is an approximation algorithm for performing an n-body simulation. It is notable for having order O(nlogn) compared to a direct-sum algorithm which would be O(n^2).

Here I simulate N particles that interact with the physical force of gravity in parallel. The data structures used for the implementation include **Quadtree** and **Sector Matrix**.

Scala has been used to develop the project for the ease of parallel programming. Scala has this plethora of parallel structures available as a part of its general connection framework.

To run:
> prerequisite: sbt - an open source build tool for scala and java  
> clone the repository  
> cd <path to the cloned directory>  
> sbt ... might take some time to initialize  
> compile  
> run ... if it tells you multiple Main classes detected, press 1 and hit enter  

Note: The code was designed as a part of an online course undertaken at Coursea ("Parallel Programming"). In case you are doing the same course, kindly do not copy the code to complete the course. The code was modified so if you use copy the code, you will run into errors. Always remember the Coursera Honor Code.
